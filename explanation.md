# Dairy Plant Demand Forecasting System - Simple Explanation
## For Faculty Presentation

---

## What is this project?

Think of this project as a **smart assistant for dairy companies** that can predict how much milk, butter, cheese, and other dairy products people will buy in the future. Just like weather forecasting helps us plan our day, this system helps dairy companies plan their production.

---

## Why do we need this?

**The Problem:**
- Dairy companies like Amul, Mother Dairy never know exactly how much to produce
- Too little production = customers can't buy, company loses money
- Too much production = products expire, wastage, company loses money
- Manual guessing is often wrong and costly

**Our Solution:**
- Use historical sales data to learn patterns
- Apply artificial intelligence to predict future demand
- Help companies make smart production decisions
- Compare performance across different companies

---

## How does it work? (In simple terms)

### Step 1: Feed Historical Data
- Companies upload their past sales data (like a CSV file from Excel)
- Data includes: dates, products, quantities sold, prices
- System automatically checks if data is correct and complete

### Step 2: Train the AI Model
- The system learns from patterns in historical data
- It understands seasonal trends (more ice cream in summer)
- It recognizes weekly patterns (more milk on weekends)
- Uses Facebook's Prophet algorithm (a proven forecasting method)

### Step 3: Predict the Future
- System generates forecasts for next 7, 14, 30, 60, or 90 days
- Shows confidence levels (how sure the prediction is)
- Provides upper and lower bounds for risk management

### Step 4: AI-Powered Analysis & Recommendations
- Uses Google's Gemini AI for intelligent business insights
- Analyzes forecast patterns and identifies trends
- Provides strategic recommendations for business growth
- Compares performance across companies with AI insights
- Generates executive summaries for management

### Step 5: Smart Production Planning
- Suggests optimal production quantities
- Calculates safety stock (backup inventory)
- Estimates capacity utilization
- Provides cost analysis and resource planning
