## ü§ñ Page 4: Model Training

### What is this page?
This is the **AI classroom** where the computer learns from your historical data to become smart at predicting future sales. Think of it like teaching a student using past exam papers so they can predict future exam questions.

### What does it show?
- **Training configuration**: Choose which products to train and settings

- **Customization**: Allows fine-tuning for specific products

### Algorithm Used: Facebook Prophet
**Why Prophet?**
- **Designed for business**: Built specifically for business forecasting
- **Handles seasonality**: Automatically finds patterns like "more ice cream in summer"
- **Works with missing data**: Still works if some data is missing
- **Provides confidence**: Tells you how sure the prediction is
- **Fast and reliable**: Proven by companies like Facebook, Uber, etc.

### How Prophet Works:
1. **Trend detection**: Finds if sales are generally going up or down
2. **Seasonality**: Discovers weekly/monthly/yearly patterns
3. **Holiday effects**: Accounts for special events and holidays
4. **Uncertainty**: Calculates how confident each prediction is

### Model Training Process:
```
Step 1: Prepare data (convert to Prophet format)
Step 2: Configure model (set seasonality, parameters)
Step 3: Train model (Prophet learns patterns)
Step 4: Validate model (test accuracy on historical data)
Step 5: Save model (store for future use)
Step 6: Show results (display performance metrics)
```

### Performance Metrics Explained:
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average difference between prediction and reality
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Penalizes big mistakes more
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Shows error as percentage
  - Less than 10% = Excellent
  - 10-20% = Good
  - 20-50% = Acceptable
  - More than 50% = Needs improvement

### How it helps users:
1. **Data scientists**: Configure and optimize AI models
2. **Business managers**: See prediction accuracy levels
3. **Production teams**: Trust the forecasting system
4. **IT administrators**: Manage and maintain models

### Model Persistence Innovation:
